# DropCoins

Problem Statement
    	There is a rectangle divided into 1x1 cells. Each cell is either empty or it contains a single coin.
        You can apply the following operation repeatedly.
        First, choose one of the directions: up, down, left, or right.
        Then, move all coins in the chosen direction by exactly 1 cell. 
        If this would cause a coin to move out of the rectangle, the coin drops out from the rectangle and disappears.
        Your objective in this problem is to apply the operations so that the number of coins 
          remaining on the rectangle becomes exactly K.
        You are given the int K and a String[] board that describes the initial state of the rectangle. 
        More precisely, character j of element i of board is 'o' if i-th row of j-th column of the rectangle contains a coin,
          and it is '.' otherwise.
        Return the minimum number of operations you have to perform. If the objective is impossible, return -1.

Examples
0)	
    	
{".o.."
,"oooo"
,"..o."}
3
Returns: 2
One of the optimal solutions is to move coins to the right twice.
1)	
    	
{".....o"
,"......"
,"oooooo"
,"oooooo"
,"......"
,"o....."}
12
Returns: 3
One of the optimal solutions:
move coins up (1 coin drops, 13 remain)
move coins down
move coins down again (1 coin drops, 12 remain)
