This is my attempts at some TopCoder SRM Algorithm challenges in Clojure. I'm sharing my solutions so that I can blog about the solutions and to get feedback from others and learn how I could solve these problems better.

I'm also hoping that somehow others may learn something from these bits of code. Maybe techniques you never thought of, or something. Here's to hoping :)

Regardless, enjoy - your feedback would be hugely appreciated!
